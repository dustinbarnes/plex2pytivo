# Plex to PyTivo #

You have Plex managing your media. PyTivo will stream it there. But they have different metadata systems. 

This lets you use the Plex metadata as the canonical source, and it will write the metadata files (choosing to use the .meta folder method). It uses the sqlite3 database that Plex uses.

Usage is with Gradle.
